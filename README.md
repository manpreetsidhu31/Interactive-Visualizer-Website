For Diploma Final Year Project we created a Interactive Visualizer Website to help Visualize DSA Concepts like Stack,Queue and Algorithms, through visualizations coded by us. We mainly use HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and Bootstrap for this project.
We mainly have two modules - User and Admin, and a Quiz section. User can Login/ Register, understand concepts via visualizations provided and take quizzes. There is also a leaderboard of all registered users and their pints on the leaderboard. Admin can create quizzes, add quiz sections and question/answers, respond to queries send by user and also email specific users via the website.
The quiz also has a timer and the admin can set timer too for each quiz provided. Our website was hosted on localhost and used Xampp, PHPMyadmin for backend.
