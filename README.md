# Real-Time-Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-Sytem
This is a Final Year BE Project in Machine Learning titled "Real Time Indian Sign Language Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network". Created a ISL prediciton and recognition system using a 4 layer CNN Model that I engineered myself. The dataset for all 26 letters A-Z was captured by me and my team and was preprocesses by us before being fed into the network. Here is our model specifics:

Here are the accuracies for all letters

Further, i added screenshots for our UI for this project. After the letters our predicted, you press a button to display the letter and hence create a word. Accuracies are shown as well. Text to speech button converts the displayed txt to speech and the clear button clears the text.
