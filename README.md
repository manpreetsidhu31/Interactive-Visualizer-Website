For Diploma Final Year Project we created a Interactive Visualizer Website to help Visualize DSA Concepts like Stack,Queue and Algorithms, through visualizations coded by us. We mainly use HTML, CSS, PHP, Javascript and Bootstrap for this project.
We mainly have two modules - User and Admin, and a Quiz section. User can Login/ Register, understand concepts via visualizations provided and take quizzes. There is also a leaderboard of all registered users and their pints on the leaderboard. Admin can create quizzes, add quiz sections and question/answers, respond to queries send by user and also email specific users via the website.
The quiz also has a timer and the admin can set timer too for each quiz provided. Our website was hosted on localhost and used Xampp, PHPMyadmin for backend.

Screenshots of our project and website are provided below:-

We added multiple pages like below to provide user with theory for all visual concepts that we displayed on our website

The stack and queue visualizations were done in css and javascript. All visulzation motions were coded in Javascript. The buttons allow user to view how push, pop, dequeue and enqueue operations work. Stack and Queue Visualizations:-

We show multiple sorting visualizations namely bubble, selection and insertion sort. The array algorithms are coded in javascript which moves around the CSS elements to visually show the sorting process to user. Sorting Array Visualizations:-

The following Djikstra and BST visualizations make use of canvas and all animations are coded in javascript mainly. Djikstra Algorithm Visualizations and Binary Search Tree Visualizations are done using PHP and Javascript:-

This website allows those who understand concepts better visualized a lit to understand important DSA Concepts and it proves as a good coding exercise for all important algorithms while creating all visualizations. It helped us understand all visualization processes and all algorithms for stack, sorting, etc.
