# Real-Time-Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition-Sytem
This is a Final Year BE Project in Machine Learning titled "Real Time Indian Sign Language Recognition using Convolutional Neural Network". Created a ISL prediciton and recognition system using a 4 layer CNN Model that I engineered myself. The dataset for all 26 letters A-Z was captured by me and my team and was preprocesses by us before being fed into the network. Here is our model specifics:- Our CNN consists fof 4 layers, 4 convolutional layers and 3 dense layers. the leyrs went from 32, 64, 128, 256 filters respectively. This model for us yielded the best results and accuracies for all letters. We made use of Adam Optimizer. Real time prediction was done using tkinter package.

Here are the accuracies for all letters:

Further, i added screenshots for our UI for this project. After the letters our predicted, you press a button to display the letter and hence create a word. Accuracies are shown as well. Text to speech button converts the displayed txt to speech and the clear button clears the text.

Here are our accuracies for our testing and validation dataset:
